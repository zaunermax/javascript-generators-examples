# Don't yield to unknown, pull the power of JavaScript generators

Welcome to my code snippets repository 👋

All code I use in my talk was thought out here and also tweaked in this repo.
Feel free to clone this repo and play around with the code examples. Also, if
you encounter problems in the code feel free to shoot me a quick PR 🙌

Maybe also leave a ⭐️ if you want to show some appreciation, I always
appreciate free internet points 🤗

## Requirements

The easiest way to run the examples is by
[installing](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) and using `bun`. You can also ofc
run the scripts with `npx ts-node script.ts`.

some of them also use third party libs though, so make sure to install the deps
first (with bun it's `bun install`, which is blazingly ultra omega giga edge llm
blockchain fast!!!)

> "Why did you use bun, do you want to be edgy and cool?"

Actually I found `bun` to be a super useful tool when running small typescript
scripts. If I compare `bun` to any similar other tool like `ts-node` I must say
that `bun` is a lot faster in comparison. It just immediately executes the
script. Sooo that's why I opted to use bun here to experiment. Also, just
running `bun --watch script.ts` is suuper convenient too.
