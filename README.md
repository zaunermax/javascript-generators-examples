# Don't yield to unknown, pull the power of JavaScript generators

Welcome to my code snippets repository 👋

All code I use in my talk was thought out here and also tweaked in this repo.
Feel free to clone this repo and play around with the code examples. Maybe also
leave a ⭐️if you want to show some appreciation 🤗

## Requirements

The easiest way to run the examples is by
[installing](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) and using `bun`. You can also ofc
run the scripts with `npx ts-node script.ts`.

> "Why did you use bun, do you want to be edgy and cool?"

Actually I found `bun` to be a super useful tool when running small typescript
scripts. If I compare `bun` to any similar other tool like `ts-node` I must say
that `bun` is a lot faster in comparison. It just immediately executes the
script. Sooo that's why I opted to use bun here to experiment. Also, just
running `bun script.ts --watch` is suuper convenient too.
